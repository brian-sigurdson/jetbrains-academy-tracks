# jetbrains-academy-tracks
This is to document my use of [JetBrains Academy's techology tracks](https://www.jetbrains.com/academy/).

Some of the earliest projects ("easy" directories) generally are not sophisticated and I tried to use the tools expected of that stage in the track's journey.

The repository is for personal use and practice.
